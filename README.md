potterswheel
============

This processing program tries to imitate a potters wheel using a continuous triangle_strip.
You can save your 3D model as .obj by pressing 'r'.
Be aware that my approach is not optimal and gets very slow in quite a short time. I have ideas on how to
implement it more efficient (with custom Vertex Buffer Objects), however I don't have time to do so. Maybe I'll rewrite this in the future, maybe not.

**(!)** For obj-export you need the library from nervoussystem ( https://github.com/nervoussystem/OBJExport )
