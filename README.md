potterswheel
============

This processing program tries to imitate a potters wheel using a continuous triangle_strip.
You can save your 3D model as .obj by pressing 'r'.
Be aware that my approach is not optimal and gets very slow in quite a short time. I have ideas on how to
implement it to be more efficient (with Vertex Buffer Objects), as well as other improvements (custom fragment shader, multitouch support).
Unfortunately I won't have time to do so in the near future. Maybe I'll rewrite this someday, maybe not.

**(!)** For obj-export you need the library from nervoussystem ( https://github.com/nervoussystem/OBJExport )
